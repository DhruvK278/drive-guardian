## Project Overview
In this groundbreaking project, we're not just observing the road; we're analyzing it comprehensively. Our system goes beyond mere object detection by predicting potential hazards, providing drivers with crucial insights to navigate safely. By seamlessly integrating upscaling techniques, we enhance the clarity and accuracy of the video feed, ensuring precise analysis.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: Our system provides sophisticated real-time analysis of road conditions, continuously monitoring for potential hazards.
- **Object Detection and Prediction**: Utilizing advanced algorithms, we detect objects and predict potential hazards, empowering drivers with proactive insights.
- **Enhanced Video Clarity**: Through seamless integration of upscaling techniques, we enhance the clarity and accuracy of the video feed for precise analysis.
- **Driver Prompting System**: When an object veers too close, our system prompts drivers to take breaks, mitigating potential accidents and ensuring a smoother journey for all.

## How it Works
1. **Data Collection**: Dashcam videos are collected and fed into our system.
2. **Real-time Analysis**: Our system performs real-time analysis using advanced algorithms.
3. **Object Detection and Prediction**: Objects and potential hazards are detected and predicted.
4. **Driver Prompting**: Drivers are prompted when potential hazards are identified, ensuring proactive safety measures.
