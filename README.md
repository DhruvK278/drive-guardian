## Background
With the increasing number of road accidents, Drive Guardian aims to enhance driver safety by providing a tool that automatically applies brakes when necessary. Our application leverages advanced machine learning algorithms, such as YOLO and lane detection, to ensure precise brake timing, reducing the risk of accidents.
 
## Description of Project
Our project aims to enhance the safety of drivers and passengers alike by leveraging live feeds from dashcam videos and utilizing advanced algorithms for real-time analysis of applying brakes.

## Features
- Real-time Analysis: Our system provides sophisticated real-time analysis of road conditions, continuously monitoring for potential hazards.
- Object Detection and Prediction: Utilizing advanced algorithms, we detect objects and predict potential hazards, empowering drivers with proactive insights.
- Enhanced Video Clarity: Through seamless integration of upscaling techniques, we enhance the clarity and accuracy of the video feed for precise analysis.

### Input
User-provided dashcam video or stream with their device.

### Data Preprocessing


### Sentiment Analysis Techniques
- Utilized advanced NLP techniques, including sentiment lexicons and machine learning models.
- Developed an ML model to classify textual data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.
- Leveraged NLP models from `Hugging Face transformers` to achieve exceptional accuracy in sentiment classification.
- Utilized `VADER` (NLP-based model) for bulk data analysis.
- Trained a `naive Bayes classifier` specifically for analyzing reviews.

### Dataset
- Size ranges from 40,000 to 50,000 samples.

### Output
Sentiment scores and visualizations depicting sentiment trends.
