# Drive Guardian

Welcome to the Drive Guardian project repository! Here, we're dedicated to revolutionizing road safety through cutting-edge technology. Our project aims to enhance the safety of drivers and passengers alike by leveraging live feeds from dashcam videos and utilizing advanced algorithms for real-time analysis.

## Project Overview
In this groundbreaking project, we're not just observing the road; we're analyzing it comprehensively. Our system goes beyond mere object detection by predicting potential hazards, providing drivers with crucial insights to navigate safely. By seamlessly integrating upscaling techniques, we enhance the clarity and accuracy of the video feed, ensuring precise analysis.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Analysis**: Our system provides sophisticated real-time analysis of road conditions, continuously monitoring for potential hazards.
- **Object Detection and Prediction**: Utilizing advanced algorithms, we detect objects and predict potential hazards, empowering drivers with proactive insights.
- **Enhanced Video Clarity**: Through seamless integration of upscaling techniques, we enhance the clarity and accuracy of the video feed for precise analysis.

## How it Works
1. **Data Collection**: Dashcam videos are collected and fed into our system.
2. **Real-time Analysis**: Our system performs real-time analysis using advanced algorithms.
3. **Lane Detection and Prediction**: Lane detection and potential hazards are detected and predicted.
